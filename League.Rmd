The International Underground Excavation League is a success between alternative sports, however the staff responsible for organizing the events doesn’t understand computers at all, they only know how to dig and the sport rule set. As such, you were hired to solve the League’s problem.

Select the three first placed with the initial phrase "Podium: " and select the last two, which will be demoted to a lower league with the initial phrase “Demoted:".


```{r setup, include=FALSE}

library(DBI)
db <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), dbname = "sql.sqlite")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(connection = "db")
```

```{sql}

CREATE TABLE league(
  position INTEGER,
  team CHARACTER VARYING (255)
);

```

```{sql}

INSERT INTO league(position, team)
