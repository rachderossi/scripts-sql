In the past the studio has made an event where several movies were on sale, we want to know what movies these were.

Your job to help us is to select the ID and name of movies whose price is less than 2.00.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

library(DBI)
db <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), dbname = "sql.sqlite")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(connection = "db")
```

```{sql}

CREATE TABLE prices (
  id numeric PRIMARY KEY,
  categorie varchar(50),
  value numeric
);

```

```{sql}

INSERT INTO prices (id , categorie, value)
VALUES
  (1,	'Releases',	3.50),
  (2,	'Bronze Seal',	2.00),
  (3,	'Silver Seal',	2.50),
  (4,	'Gold Seal',	3.00),
  (5,	'Promotion',	1.50);

```

```{sql}

CREATE TABLE movies (
  id numeric PRIMARY KEY,
  name varchar(50),
  id_prices numeric REFERENCES prices (id)
);

```

```{sql}

INSERT INTO movies (id, name, id_prices)
VALUES
  (1,	'Batman',	3),
  (2,	'The Battle of the Dark River',	3),
  (3,	'White Duck',	5),
  (4,	'Breaking Barriers',	4),
  (5,	'The Two Hours',	2);

```

```{sql}

select movies.id, movies.name from movies
inner join prices on movies.id_prices = prices.id
where prices.value < 2;

```
