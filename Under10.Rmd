The financial sector of the company needs a report that shows the ID and the name of the products whose price is less than 10 or greater than 100.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

library(DBI)
db <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), dbname = "sql.sqlite")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(connection = "db")

```

```{sql}


CREATE TABLE products (
  id NUMERIC PRIMARY KEY,
  name CHARACTER VARYING (255),
  amount NUMERIC,
  price NUMERIC
);

```

```{sql}

INSERT INTO products (id, name, amount, price)
VALUES 
  (1,	'Two-door wardrobe',	100,	80),
  (2,	'Dining table',	1000,	560),
  (3,	'Towel holder',	10000,	5.50),
  (4,	'Computer desk',	350,	100),
  (5,	'Chair',	3000,	210.64),
  (6,	'Single bed',	750,	99);
  
```

```{sql}

select id, name from products where price < 10 or price > 100;

```
