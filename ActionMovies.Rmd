A video store contractor hired her services to catalog her movies. They need you to select the code and the name of the movies whose description of the genre is 'Action'.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

library(DBI)
db <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), dbname = "sql.sqlite")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(connection = "db")

```

```{sql}

CREATE TABLE genres (
  id numeric PRIMARY KEY,
  description varchar(50)
);

```

```{sql}

INSERT INTO genres (id, description)
VALUES
  (1,	'Animation'),
  (2,	'Horror'),
  (3,	'Action'),
  (4,	'Drama'),
  (5,	'Comedy');

```

```{sql}

CREATE TABLE movies (
  id numeric PRIMARY KEY,
  name varchar(50),
  id_genres numeric REFERENCES genres (id)
);

```

```{sql}

INSERT INTO movies (id, name, id_genres)
VALUES
  (1,	'Batman',	3),
  (2,	'The Battle of the Dark River',	3),
  (3,	'White Duck',	1),
  (4,	'Breaking Barriers',	4),
  (5,	'The Two Hours',	2);

```

```{sql}

select movies.id, movies.name from movies
inner join genres on movies.id_genres = genres.id
where genres.description like 'action';

```
