The manager of Mangojata Lawyers requested a report on the current lawyers.

The manager wants you to show him the name of the lawyer with the most clients, the one with the fewest and the client average considering all lawyers.

OBS: Before presenting the average, show a field called Average to make the report more readable. The average must be presented as an integer.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}

library(DBI)
db <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), dbname = "sql.sqlite")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(connection = "db")
```

```{sql}

CREATE TABLE lawyers(
  register INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  customers_number INTEGER
 );

```

```{sql}

 INSERT INTO lawyers(register, name, customers_number)
 VALUES (1648, 'Marty M. Harrison', 5),
	(2427, 'Jonathan J. Blevins', 15),
	(3365, 'Chelsey D. Sanders', 20),
	(4153, 'Dorothy W. Ford', 16),
	(5525, 'Penny J. Cormier', 6);
  
```

```{sql}

select name, customers_number
from lawyers
where customers_number = (select max(customers_number) from lawyers)
union all
select name, customers_number
from lawyers
where customers_number = (select min(customers_number) from lawyers)
union all
select 'Average' as name, cast(avg(customers_number) as int) as customers_number from lawyers;

```
