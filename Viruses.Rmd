Viruses are evolving, but new research has proven that by switching some proteins the vaccine becomes unbeatable. The protein H1(Hemagglutinin) when replaced by the X protein (Xenomorphina) has interesting effects against almost every viral disease. Some conspiracists say that after the vaccine’s discovery some strange 3 meters tall creatures were found in the surroundings of the laboratories, but this is clearly a lie.

Therefore, you must replace every string “H1”( Hemagglutinin ) by 'X' ( Xenomorphina ).

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

library(DBI)
db <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), dbname = "sql.sqlite")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(connection = "db")
```

```{sql}

CREATE TABLE virus (
  id INTEGER,
  name VARCHAR(255)
);
  
```

```{sql}

INSERT INTO virus(id, name)
VALUES 
      (1, 'H1RT'),
      (2, 'H7H1'),
      (3, 'HUN8'),
      (4, 'XH1HX'),
      (5, 'XXXX');

```

```{sql}

select replace(name, 'H1', 'X') from virus;

```
