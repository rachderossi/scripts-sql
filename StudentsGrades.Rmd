The semester is over at South Transylvania University. Every grade was closed, and only Alchemy 104 haven’t published its list of approved students.

Therefore, you should show the word 'Approved: ' alongisde the the name of a student and the grade, for those who have been approved (grade ≥7).

Remember to sort the list by grade (higher grades first).


```{r setup, include=FALSE}

library(DBI)
db <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), dbname = "sql.sqlite")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(connection = "db")
```

```{sql}

CREATE TABLE students(
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  grade NUMERIC
);

```

```{sql}

INSERT INTO students(id, name, grade)
VALUES (1, 'Terry B. Padilla',7.3),
       (2, 'William S. Ray',0.6),
       (3, 'Barbara A. Gongora',5.2),
       (4, 'Julie B. Manzer', 6.7),
       (5, 'Teresa J. Axtell', 4.6),
       (6, 'Ben M. Dantzler', 9.6);
  
```

```{sql}

select concat(' ', 'Approved:', name) as name, grade from students 
where grade >= 7 
order by grade desc;

```
