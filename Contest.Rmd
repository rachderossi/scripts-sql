The Mars Technology University has Open Positions for researchers. However, the computer responsible for processing the candidates' data is broken. You must present the candidate list, containing the name and final score (with two decimal places of precision) of each candidate. Remember to show the list ordered by score (highest first).

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

library(DBI)
db <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), dbname = "sql.sqlite")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(connection = "db")
```

```{sql}

CREATE TABLE  candidate(
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR (255)
);

```

```{sql}

INSERT INTO candidate(id, name)
VALUES 
	   (1, 'Michael P Cannon'),
       (2, 'Barbra J Cable'),
       (3, 'Ronald D Jones'),
       (4, 'Timothy K Fitzsimmons'),
       (5, 'Ivory B Morrison'),
       (6, 'Sheila R Denis'),
       (7, 'Edward C Durgan'),
       (8, 'William K Spencer'),
       (9, 'Donna D Pursley'),
       (10, 'Ann C Davis');
  
```

```{sql}

CREATE TABLE score(
  candidate_id INTEGER REFERENCES candidate (id),
  math NUMERIC,
  specific NUMERIC,
  project_plan NUMERIC
);

```

```{sql}

INSERT INTO score(candidate_id, math, specific, project_plan)
VALUES 
	   (1, 76, 58, 21),
       (2, 4, 5, 22),
       (3, 15, 59, 12),
       (4, 41, 42, 99),
       (5, 22, 90, 9),
       (6, 82, 77, 15),
       (7, 82, 99, 56),
       (8, 11, 4, 22),
       (9, 16, 29, 94),
       (10, 1, 7, 59);
       
```

```{sql}

select candidate.name, round(((score.math*2) + (score.specific*3) + (score.project_plan*5))/10,2) as 'average' from score
inner join candidate on candidate.id = score.candidate_id
order by average desc;

```
