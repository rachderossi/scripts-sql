The Global Organization of Characters at Peopleâ€™s Names (GOCPN) made a census to figure how many characters people have in theirs names.

To help OMCNP, you must show the number of characters of each name sorted by decreasing number of characters.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}

library(DBI)
db <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), dbname = "sql.sqlite")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(connection = "db")
```

```{sql}

CREATE TABLE people(
	id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
	name varchar(255)
);

```

```{sql}

INSERT INTO people(id, name)
VALUES 
      (1, 'Karen'),
      (2, 'Manuel'),
      (3, 'Ygor'),
      (4, 'Valentine'),
      (5, 'Jo');
  
```

```{sql}

select name, length(name) as 'length' from people
order by length desc;

```
